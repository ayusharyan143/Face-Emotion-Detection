## Overview

The model is trained to classify images into one of the following emotions:
- Angry
- Disgusted
- Fearful
- Happy
- Neutral
- Sad
- Surprised

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required Python packages using pip:  pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib numpy

## Usage

### Prepare the Dataset
Download the FER-2013 dataset and organize it into the following directory structure:

Dataset/
    └── FER-2013 Dataset/
        ├── train/
        └── test/


### Run the Training Script
Execute the training script to train the emotion detection model.

### Load the Model
After training, the model architecture and weights will be saved. Load these using the provided script for real-time emotion detection.

### Run the Emotion Detection
Start the webcam feed to see the real-time emotion detection in action.

## Model Training
The model is defined using the Keras Sequential API and consists of several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers. The training script includes:

- Data augmentation and preprocessing
- Model compilation with Adam optimizer
- Model training and evaluation

## Face Detection
The system uses a Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection. The model processes each detected face to predict the corresponding emotion.

## Results
After training, the model is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics plotted over epochs. The model's performance can be visualized using Matplotlib.
